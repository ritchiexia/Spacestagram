Utilizes NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) Open API to display pictures and descriptions from previous and current posts.

Currently displays 5 random posts upon loading the page, as well as their titles, dates, and descriptions.

TODO:
- handle video posts
- add 'Like' button functionality
- add a navigation bar that allows users to choose most recent, random, or specific posts
- make each post have a maximum-line preview, and have a button to expand the description
